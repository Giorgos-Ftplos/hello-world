As the Greeks say "The beginning is half of everything"

Hello GitHub!

I'm Giorgos. We greeks have a quote that says "The beginning is half of everything". 
The meaning is that if you start doing something you are already halfway of finish it.
Because you have stopped thinking about it and you began doing it.
